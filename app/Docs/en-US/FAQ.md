## Is there a character sheet and where can I find it?

Yes, there is a character sheet you can export as a PDF! To do that, you have to end hero creation in the character's profile first. To do *that*, you need to have a maximum of 10 AP left &ndash; and you can't have too much AP spent, obviously. If you end it, you'll see the new tab *Character Sheet* above. In that tab you'll get a preview of your sheet and then you can export it via the button in the top left corner!

Might be relevant: There's only an DIN A4 version available!

## I can't add spells or liturgical chants!

It's likely you do not meet the prerequisites for adding spells or liturgical chants:

### Spells:

- Buy advantage *Spellcaster*.
- Buy the magical special ability *Tradition*.

### Liturgical Chants:

* Buy advantage *Blessed One*.
* Buy the blessed special ability *Tradition*.

## I can't buy stronger invocations!

Stronger invocation rituals have prerequisites that you can find in the **Core Rules** on page **263**:

* Invocatio Minor: Invocatio Minima 10
* Invocatio Maior: Invocatio Minor 12
* Elemental Servant: Manifesto 10
* Call Djinn: Elemental Servant 12

## Why do I have the combat sheet twice?!

The first lists the default armor from the CR below *Armor* on the sheet. The second lists the hit zone armor with their different PRO values per hit zone there instead. If you have both sheets it's likely you have both default armor and hit zone armor for your character.

## How can I buy additional LP/AE/KP?

That depends on whether you are still in hero creation phase or have completed that.

* *During hero creation* you can add additional LP/AE/KP via the advantages *Increased Life Points/Arcane Power/Karma Points I-VII*. You should use them if you are interested in higher values because you can usually not buy advantages afterwards!
* *After hero creation*, to add additional LP/AE/KP, use the &raquo;+&laquo; button below the respective energy in the *Attributes* tab. The maximum values for these are calculated by using the rules from the **Core Rules** p. **350&ndash;352**.

## Where do I find my saved characters?

Characters and other files such as the application configuration can be found at the following locations, depending on the OS you use:

- *Windows:* `C:/Users/<User>/AppData/Roaming/Optolith`, where `<User>` is the name of your user folder
- *Linux:* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Optolith` or `~/.config/Optolith`
- *macOS:* `~/Library/Application Support/Optolith`

A list of relevant files:

- `heroes.json ` contains all heroes saved in Optolith
- `config.json` contains the configuration of your Optolith. It does not contain critical data but things like color theme, language (only if you selected a specific one) and alike.
  *A note on Windows:* `AppData` is a *hidden* folder. To be able to see it, check out the Windows Explorer, go to the *View* tab and activate the setting *Hidden elements*.
